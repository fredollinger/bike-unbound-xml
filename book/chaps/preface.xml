The first draft of this book was written on my blog:
<ulink url="http://cyclingunbound.wordpress.com">
Cycling Unbound</ulink> which was written between 2009 and 2014.

Part statistical analysis, part cheerleader, part spiritual seeker, and part comedian, the blog has had limited appeal, but for me it was a place for me to dump my ideas which I usually got while riding to work each day. Through the years, I was able to work through my own personal issues as well as my ideas on where cycling in the United States should be headed.

I never expected a big readership; I merely enjoyed blogging for its own enjoyment.

Recently, in mid-2014, I spoke to visitor advocates who were shocked to hear a recent report that forty percent of cycling deaths in the United States were hit from behind collisions.

Since, due to research, I had known about this for years, I was not surprised to see this result. Until I spoke to the visitor, I had not known that these statistics were common knowledge. This got me wondering. What other "common sense" truths which I learned through reading pdfs online, basic statistical analysis, and brainstorming, were unknown to the wider cycling world?
</para>
<para>
Thus, the main motivation of this book is to get whatever knowledge I learned out there for the wider cycling community in the hopes that it save someone some time. My other goal was to overhaul my blog which is dated in some parts, angry in others, and an embarassement in most ways.
