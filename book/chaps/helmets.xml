One of the biggest debates in the cycling world is over cycling helmets. Many people think tha they are the "single best way to protect one from a head injury." Others believe that helmets are over-rated at best and at worse, a hinderance to getting more people riding bicycles.

As per the <link linkend='rules_of_engagement'>Rule of Engagement Chapter</link>, the main causes of making decisions is based on data, reason, and emotions.

<para>
First let's talk about the emotional reason that we wear helmets. The main reason is to make cycling safer. There should be no other reason.

Anything that makes the public safer is a public safety intervention which comes under the Center for Disease control. Safety devices, like medicine should be proven with science. No one would take an unproven safety intervention seriously without the science to back it up.

<title>Safety Studies of Helmets</title>
<para>This chapter is going to be shorter than it could be. There are many debates, online, about the relative safety of helmets. I'm going to stick to some of the most compelling arguments.
</para>
<para>
First, let's talk about the argument from a vaccum. This is basically saying statments such as "you never know" in order push for helmets. I'd argue that "you never know" is a statement of ignorance. If we don't know if helmets are useful then like other useless safety interventions, they are not to be recommended. We only have limited time and money and to make things safer, we need to spend wisely.
