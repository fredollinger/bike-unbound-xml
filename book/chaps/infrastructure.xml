<title>Infrastructure Controversy</title>
<para>
Before we get started on this chapter, it needs to be said that in terms of actual traffic engineering, there is no controvery regarding the importance of infrastructure.
</para>
<para>
To put it another way, real cycling advocacy means advocacy for cycling infrastructure. Advocating for safer cycling is advocacy for infrastructure.
</para>
<para>
There is no alternative to cycling infrastructure, if cycling is going to be safe, succssful and fun. This means, that other forms of so called advocacy such as pushing for helmets, classes, and more law enforcement are a distraction and waste of money and time. When people who should know better push for these things rather than infrastructure, they are acting in either ignorace or bad faith.
